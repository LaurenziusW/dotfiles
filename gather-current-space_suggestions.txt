Here's the suggested change for the `local-bin/.local/bin/gather-current-space` script:

**Original line:**
    yabai -m query --windows | jq -r ".[] | select(.space != $CURRENT_SPACE) | .id" | \

**Suggested new line:**
    yabai -m query --windows | jq -r ".[] | select(.space != $CURRENT_SPACE and .[\"is-visible\"] == true and .[\"is-minimized\"] == false) | .id" | \

**Explanation:**
The error "could not locate the window to act on!" occurs because yabai sometimes cannot manipulate windows that are minimized or hidden, even if they appear in the `query --windows` output.

This change modifies the `jq` filter to include two additional conditions:
1.  `.["is-visible"] == true`: Ensures that only visible windows are considered.
2.  `.["is-minimized"] == false`: Excludes minimized windows from the selection.

This should prevent the script from attempting to move windows that yabai cannot act upon, thus eliminating the "could not locate the window to act on!" errors.
